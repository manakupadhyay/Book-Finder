# Book Finder :books::mag:

An application made with ExpressJS, that allow users to enter the name of a book and displays some basic information about it. It uses Google Books API.
Basically, the main motive behind building this \*mini-project\* was to get familiar with APIs. I learnt how to make API calls, handling data 
that is received as a response, manipulating received data, etc.
